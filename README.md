## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View the current time and location information based on their IP address
- View additional information about the date and time in the expanded state
- Be shown the correct greeting and background image based on the time of day they're visiting the site
- Generate random programming quotes by clicking the refresh icon near the quote

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework


### What I learned

Just finished the challenge but I'll keep work on it just to make it a little more awesome where needed.

Proud of this grid I created:
```css
#less-div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 17em;
  margin-bottom: 0px;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20.3871px);
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 3fr  1fr;
  padding-top: 48px;
  padding-left: 26px;
  padding-right: 25px;
  padding-bottom: 48px;
  color: white;
}
```

### Continued development

Overall I want to improve my front-end developer skills. Maybe I will also try to work with a testing tool like jest later on in this project.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me to understand Grid.
